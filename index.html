<h2>History</h2>

<p>Situated on a bend of the Mississippi River 100 miles from its mouth, New Orleans has
  been the chief city of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexicoâ€™s busiest northern port since the early 1700s.
  Founded by the French, ruled for 40 years by the Spanish and bought by the United States in the
  1803 Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans is known for its distinct Creole culture and vibrant history.
  Significant battles of the War of 1812 and the Civil War were fought over the city.
  In its last hundred years the key struggles of New Orleans have been social (poverty, racial strife) and
  natural (hurricanes, floods and slowly sinking land).</p>
